# Slate - Animation Tutorial

In Slate, it's possible to see a preview of how an animation will look. The animation is based on one or more "frames" or "cells" in your image. This tutorial will show one way to create these frames and then go through the process of customising the animation settings.

Firstly, we'll start off with a single frame, composed of three layers:

The initial project can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/mitchcurtis/slate/blob/master/tests/manual/screenshots/resources/animation-tutorial-1.slp).

We want to have 6 frames in our animation, so we need to increase the size of the canvas. To do so, open the Change Canvas Size dialog by clicking on the tool button in the left-hand side of the toolbar:
